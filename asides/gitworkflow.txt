working with branches
-----------------------
0. meet with your group members to review code and resolve git merge conflicts

1. (???) pull the newest code from the developement branch to your working branch 

2. resolve all conflicts

2. push your local working branch to Github
$ git push origin [working branch name]

3. create a pull request
go to the repo on Github and click "New Pull Request"
(now we can "compare" the base branch (developement branch) with your working branch)

4. code review with all group members

5. everything is fine? Pull request will be merged

6. delete your working branch

7. going back to the developement branch
$ git checkout [developement branch]

8. pull the newest version to your local repo
$ git pull

9. create your new working branche
$ git branch [working branch name]

9. git checkout your new working branch
$ git checkout [working branch name]

10. stage your changed file(s)
$ git add [file name] | $ git add .

11. commit your changes to your checkout branch with an informative commit message
$ git commit -m "[commit message]"

12. push all commits to your working branch
$ git push origin [working branch name]
